As long as you fulfill all the user stories, you can give your personal touches by adding transition, using your own images, changing colors, or even creating your own layout,...

Once you completed, submit your solutions by providing URLs for both GitHub repository and live app on Netlify and explain briefly what you have done.

For the custom domain url you'll enter in netlify, please use the following naming convention : **country-quiz-_YOUR_FIRSTNAME_.netlify.app** (replace YOUR_FIRSTNAME by your firstname)

Good luck everybody!

### Structure of the project.

#### I had two components : 
- AboutCountry  
- Result

#### In the *AboutCountry* component: 
- Imported urls from API
- Created function which contains: states, random functions and an array that handle two questions. I use *useEffect()* for passing all of the functions that I have created before.
- I aslo tried to use *Math.random()* to random the data that I get from the API.
- Finally, mapping over arrays inside the return.

### If I had more time,

I would like continuing to search a way to get the random working in the page but not only in console.log() before I will move on. Because, I can't countue get I did't get even the random country name or capital work.

### Did you learn anything new while working on this project?

I did't learn so much as I got stuck from the begining. 

### The most challenging parts
Most of the parts are challenging for me. What I mean is that I always have difficulties about the logic, on what I should use. For example, I can get an array or objects when I console but I can't get it with states.
Yet, I still need more practice.

### I would like to have more explanation about: 
- Displaying functions in states. I always got (undefined);
- Sometimes, we map when we want to get data from API but in some cases we don't need to map. It is still a bit blurry.
- Using data from API.
